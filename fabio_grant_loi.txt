Hi,

I have always been interested in electronics and especially computers and how they work. When I was little I would get junk electronic equipment and take it apart to see how it worked.
Last year I started designing a computer to be built out of discrete logic chips. Over the summer I spent a lot of time designing every detail of every circuit board that would make it up.

The computer consists of 11 custom printed circuit boards (PCBs), 211 computer chips and sockets, and some other miscellaneous parts.
Every chip plugs into a socket, meaning that none are directly soldered to any PCBs. This is because if I somehow electrically damage any chips I can simply pull them out and replace them without having to unsolder anything which often ruins the whole PCB.

During this school year I have spent a lot of time in the makerspace building the computer. There have of course been some issues but so far I have been able to fix all of them. Even though it is not yet completed it can, as of 2024-10-14 run, simple programs.

Because of the cost I am interested in having it covered by the Michael P. Fabio Exploration fund. Since I have already bought everything needed to finish the project, I know exactly what the cost is, which is $650.27.

I am excited to finally be able to run simple programs on a computer I designed myself. When I have the computer fully completed I will work on designing a compiled language meant specifically for it.

All documentation & design files are publicly available at https://github.com/HDrizzle/stack_machine.

Thanks!
