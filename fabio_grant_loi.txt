Hi, This is Hadrian Ward.

I have always been interested in electronics and especially computers and how they work. Last year I started designing my own computer to be built out of
discrete logic chips. Over the summer I spent a lot of time designing every detail of every circuit board that would make it up.

The computer will consist of 11 custom made printed circuit boards, 204 computer chips and sockets, and some other miscellaneous parts.
Every chip plugs into a socket, meaning that none are directly soldered to any PCBs. This is because if I somehow electrically damage any chips I can simply pull them out and replace them without having to unsolder anything which often ruins the whole PCB.

During this school year I have spent a lot of time in the makerspace building the computer. There have of course been some issues put so far I have been able to fix all of them.
