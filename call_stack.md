# Call stack

The call stack will be a 256 x 16 bit stack memory clocked only be the A clock and connected to the control unit for storing and retrieving return addresses for the `CALL` and `RETURN` instructions. For memory chips it will have 2 32k x 8 bit memories wired in parellel (for 16-bit word size). Since only 256 words will be needed, the extra addresses will tied to GND.
